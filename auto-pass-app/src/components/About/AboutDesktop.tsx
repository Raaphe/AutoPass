            <p className="h6 mt-2">Our team was hard at work to make this service. We are a Montreal based group of students from the C√©gep Marie-Victorin, a lively CEGEP with a new IT program that launched in 2023. Marie-Victorin is situated in the north-east end of the island which is fairly remote especially for our local public transit system. Our team was tasked of building an app so the idea of it being tied to transit was a no-brainer. Thus, AutoPass was born.</p>
